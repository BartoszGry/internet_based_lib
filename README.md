## Project Description
**[internet_based_lib](https://github.com/BartoszGry/internet_based_lib)** is the backend layer of the library system project. This project constitutes a part of my engineering work. The main goal of the project was to create a library system that integrates with the National Library's API.

In this project, I utilized Spring framework, focusing particularly on the implementation of Spring Security. This involved creating JWT tokens for authentication, encoding passwords securely, and configuring the SecurityFilterChain for managing security aspects effectively.

Additionally, the system features functionalities such as user registration, login, book search, and book borrowing. These aspects were designed and implemented to ensure smooth operation and secure access to library resources.
