## Project Description
**[internet_based_lib](https://github.com/BartoszGry/internet_based_lib)** is the backend layer of the library system project. This project constitutes a part of my engineering work. The main goal of the project was to create a library system that integrates with the National Library's API.

In this project, I utilized Spring framework, focusing particularly on the implementation of Spring Security. This involved creating JWT tokens for authentication, encoding passwords securely, and configuring the SecurityFilterChain for managing security aspects effectively.


Moreover, **[internet_based_lib_front](https://github.com/BartoszGry/internet_based_lib_front)** complements the backend with its frontend implementation. Together, these components provide a cohesive user experience, allowing functionalities like user registration, login, book search, and book borrowing. This integration ensures seamless interaction with the library system while maintaining security standards.
